**Ad-Hoc Insights** is a SQL-driven analysis project solving 10 real-world business ad-hoc requests for a leading consumer goods hardware company.  

The goal was to extract quick, actionable insights from the database to support sales, marketing, finance, and leadership decisions — covering customer performance, product trends, discounts, market share, and more. Queries were written in MySQL, with optional Power BI visuals for presentation.


## Features

- **Customer & Product Insights** — Identified top customers/products by net sales, percentage contribution, and growth trends across fiscal years.
- **Discount & Promotion Analysis** — Calculated pre-invoice discount percentages by markets/channels, highlighting high-discount retailers and impact on profitability.
- **Market Share & Trends** — Compared AtliQ's market share vs competitors, year-over-year changes, and regional performance.
- **Top Performers** — Ranked top 5/10 entities (customers, products, divisions) for sales, quantity, or unique product counts.
- **Business Request Solutions** — Direct answers to 10 ad-hoc requests (e.g., top 10 customers by contribution, products with >50% discount, new product launches).

## Key Highlights

1. **Efficient Ad-Hoc Querying**  
   Solved 10 business-critical requests using optimized MySQL queries for fast, accurate insights without full ETL.

2. **Strong SQL Proficiency**  
   Applied joins, aggregations, and subqueries to handle complex business logic.

3. **Data-Driven Recommendations**  
   Provided actionable suggestions (e.g., focus on high-contribution customers, reduce excessive discounts) based on query results.

4. **Business Impact Focus**  
   Turned raw database data into clear answers that help AtliQ improve sales strategies, pricing, and market positioning.

## Data Sources

The project uses:
1. **MySQL Database** — Core fact tables (sales, customers, products, dates) and dimensions from AtliQ Hardware schema (gdb023 or similar).
2. **Excel/CSV Files** — Supplementary data for targets, market share, or additional dimensions.

## Tech Stack Used

- MySQL
- Excel / CSV handling
- SQL best practices (readability, performance, modular queries)
